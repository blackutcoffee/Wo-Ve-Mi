## Milestones:

### Casey:

## I struggled through learning a new CSS framework, but it was worth it.

## After learning the framework, I had fun manipulating elements to stack neatly on different screen sizes.

### Garrett:

## Dealing with multiple fetch requests and accounting for the time it takes them to complete was a challenge.

## I learned about the strange things that can happen when you mix asynchronous and synchronous functions and how to work around them.

### Jennifer:

## I learned that the group could break up into teams on different efforts for the project and just meet as a group during the group project times.  It is probably a better idea for one person to be the project 

## As convenient as W3Schools is for designing cards and making design easy, it clutters the code and makes it harder to manipulate simple things.


### Lafon:

## I Enjoyed That Our Group Did Our Best To Complete All Graded Portions Before The Deadlines Both Individually And Collectively As A Group. I Really Apprecaite How Others H/elped Out When Some Team Mbrs Got Stuck At Work/School, Had Medical Emergencies, Or Just Needed Help Getting Unstuck With A Particular Project Assignment.  

## Utilizing Primary Resources (MDN, w3Schools), I Learned Mostly About Modals (Error-handling) Plus, Client-Side Storage [Cookies], Notwithstanding MVP/SEO.
